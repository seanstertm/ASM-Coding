            Hollow knight is an open world metrovania with the best soundtrack of any game I've ever played. 
            You play as a little bug investigating a ruined city, and gain abilities along the way.
            The game is quite difficult, but can appeal to many different ways of playing.

            I personally have gotten in to speedrunning this game, and the replayability is off the charts, even though it isn't a roguelike like most of my favorite games. 
            Hollow Knight has an anticipated sequel coming out... eventually. 
            It was supposed to release a while ago, but news about it has been sparce.
