            The Binding of Isaac was a flash game published in 2011, and was later recreated as a full fledged game in 2014. 
            It has received many updates throughout the years with the most recent being around 1 year ago.
            The game follows a 5 year old child who is running away from his mom into the basement of his house, since she believes god has sent her to kill him.

            Isaac is a rouguelike, meaning that every time you die, you get sent back to the beginning, but every single run is vastly different.
            The community surrounding the game puts out tons of mods to improve or add content to the game, and with 34 character and 13 bosses each to start, there's never a lack of things to do.
