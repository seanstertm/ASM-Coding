            Different to most other games on this list, Portal 2 is a puzzle game, and a sequel to the original Portal.
            The puzzles themselves are not that difficult, and the end was very underwhelming in my opinion.
            It was an absolute blast to play through though, Glados and Wheatley are both hilarious characters.

            Portal 2 has a co-op mode, which differs from the main story, and has about as much content.
            I've played through it a couple times with friends, and overall it's quite fun.
            The story in the main mode can't be beat though.
